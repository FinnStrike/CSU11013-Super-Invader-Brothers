# CSU11013-Super-Invader-Brothers
An implementation of the Space Invaders game using Processing, but with some more personal touches and usage of some IP that I definitely don't have a license for.

## Gameplay
* This game starts with a bunch of aliens slowly but surely making their way down the screen.
* Your goal is to shoot every alien to prevent them from getting to the bottom of the screen.
* You win if you manage to destroy all the aliens.
* You lose if an alien manages to get passed you.
* Also, there are three powerups to collect that will give you more of an edge:
     * The ~~Mushroom~~ Fungi-head: Grows your fireballs to twice the size!
     * The Blue Fireball: Doubles your firing speed!
     * The x2 coin: Doubles the amount of fireballs you can have onscreen!
* Be warned, each powerup can only be collected once, however the effect is permanent.
* One more thing: the aliens drop bombs. If they hit you, you die.
* To circumvent this, you are provided with two helpful shields!
* However, each shield can only take so many hits before it DIES HORRIBLY, LEAVING YOU VULNERABLE TO THE ELDRITCH MONSTERS AND THEIR EXPLOSIVE DEMON SPAWN.
* Them's the rules, unless you decide to change them.

## Controls
* Start the game by running the files in a Processing IDE.
* Actually start playing by pressing any key (like it says on the starting screen)
* Move your mouse from side to side to control ~~Mario~~ Bario
* Shoot fireballs by left-clicking your mouse

## Code
Feel free to mess around with the code as much as you want, changing some of the constants in the Constants file can give you some interesting results (like infinite ammo)!
